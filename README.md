# Life Saver Hexabot Plugin

LifeSaver is a user-friendly chat bot app designed to assist individuals during natural disasters. It allows users to share their precise location with others, enabling quick assistance in emergencies. By analyzing real-time weather data, the app determines whether the user is in a safe or dangerous situation and provides immediate alerts.


Our team participated in the TN 2056 Challenge with our agritech startup, PREDICTI, it's an IoT-powered weather station that uses AI to provide accurate weather forecasts, helping farmers manage crises. 
Soon, PREDICTI will feature Life Saver Chatbot, offering real-time updates, personalized alerts, and critical assistance during extreme weather events. This integration will benefit both farmers and everyday users, expanding the app's impact beyond agriculture.
